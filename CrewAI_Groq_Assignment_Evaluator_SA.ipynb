It is the second-largest continent in the world, with 54 countries, each with its own languages, customs, and traditions. Africa is often called the \"cradle of humanity\" because the earliest humans are believed to have lived there millions of years ago.\n",

            "One of the most fascinating things about Africa is its wildlife. It is home to animals like lions, elephants, giraffes, zebras, and rhinos.
