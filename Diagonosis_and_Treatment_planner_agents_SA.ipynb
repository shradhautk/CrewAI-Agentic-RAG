What helps with body aches from COVID?Wrapping upFAQsShare this article:OverviewA common symptom of COVID-19 is body aches.Body aches can occur in various parts of the body but are often in the head and neck region or the limbs.Over-the-counter pain medications can be used at home to treat body aches caused by COVID-19.Body aches have been known to persist beyond the time of infection, a situation known as long COVID.Body aches and COVID frequently go together. Not only is it a common symptom of the COVID infection, but research has shown body aches appearing in the early days of infection, even before the common respiratory symptoms related to the disease, such as cough, sore throat, and runny nose. 1You can experience COVID body aches almost anywhere, but they’re most common in the head, neck area, and limbs. They can also include your muscles, tendons, and ligaments, also known as muscle pain or myalgia. Body aches can go away on their own, but they can linger, and they’re often cited as one of the most frequent symptoms to persist after a COVID-19 infection, known as long COVID.2What causes body aches with COVID?Body aches are a frequent symptom of COVID, and are often felt with other symptoms such as fatigue, cough, and headaches. This pain can go together with a fever, but the whole body can also ache without it. You can experience these body aches throughout the whole body in general, or they can occur in specific places.  They mainly affect the head, the neck, and the limbs. Further research is needed to understand the association between COVID-19 and these locations. COVID body aches feel like a dull, aching sensation in your muscles. You can feel as if your mobility is limited due to the pain. The pain can range from mild to severe and can occur if you already had body aches before the infection or if you didn’t. The cause of these body aches can be due to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors that are located in various cells of the muscles and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.3 The coronavirus enters the cells through these receptors, where it can cause direct damage. Once the coronavirus enters these cells, your immune system will react. The macrophages of the immune system are cells designed to locate and destroy harmful organisms such as the coronavirus. These macrophages are known to produce proinflammatory cytokines that cause tissue inflammation. Because of this inflammation, you can experience pain in the form of body aches. It has also been determined that the ACE2 receptor pathway facilitates the transmission of pain in the spinal dorsal horn.4 5 6 7Body aches can also occur as a side effect after the COVID vaccination. The severity of this side effect can vary from person to person and should go away in a few days. You can experience body aches as a side effect after primary or booster shots. 8How long do body aches last with COVID?The body aches associated with the coronavirus are usually an early symptom of infection. In many cases, they’ll go away on their own after a few days or weeks.However, there's a considerable amount of people who experience body aches after COVID-19. If this is the case, you might have long COVID, a situation where the symptoms of a COVID infection persist after the infection has cleared. Some research suggests that body aches last about 45 days on average. Studies indicate that the reason behind this is an inflammation of the nervous system caused by the immune system as a reaction to the coronavirus. In some cases, this can cause chronic pain, which may affect your quality of life. Pain control and monitoring are essential because these muscle aches often last long. 4What else can cause body aches? Body aches are a general symptom and can be caused by many other things apart from COVID. Some other causes of body aches include: 9 10 11 12Infection with a virus such as the common cold, the flu, and the coronavirusWorking out FibromyalgiaDehydrationLupusMononucleosisStressArthritisTo be sure of the cause of your body aches, it’s crucial to keep any other symptoms that you may be experiencing in mind. If you’re in doubt, a COVID test can help determine whether or not you’ve been infected with the coronavirus. If you are, you should rest, seek COVID treatment, and keep some distance from others to avoid infecting them. If your test points out that you haven’t been infected with the coronavirus, you should consult your doctor to look at other possible causes of your body aches.What helps with body aches from COVID?COVID body aches usually go away on their own without any extra treatment. Drinking plenty of fluids and resting while your immune system fights the infection is usually the best option. If you want to relieve your pain, ibuprofen or paracetamol may be an option. Hot and cold therapy can also be used to alleviate COVID-19 body aches. A hot bath or shower can help to relax sore muscles and reduce pain, while an ice pack can be applied to the affected area to reduce inflammation.If the pain persists after the infection, consult your doctor for monitoring and treatment, as you may be experiencing symptoms of long COVID.Wrapping upBody aches often present themselves at the onset of a COVID infection. They usually go away on their own after a few days or weeks, but in some cases, they can linger on after the infection has cleared. If you’re experiencing persistent body aches after a COVID-19 infection, consult your doctor to see which treatment strategy would benefit you.FAQsQ: Is it normal to have body aches during COVID-19?A: Yes, body aches are one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19. The body aches can feel like a flu-like discomfort and can be felt in the muscles and joints. Q: Is a hot bath good for COVID-19 body aches?A: A hot bath may temporarily relieve body aches associated with COVID-19.Q: Can COVID-19 be just body aches without fever?A: Yes, COVID-19 can present with symptoms such as body aches without fever.Q: Why are COVID-19 aches worse at night?A: The body's natural sleep and wake cycle, the circadian rhythm, may play a role in pain perception. At night, when the body is in a state of rest, pain may be more pronounced because there are fewer distractions, and the body is not as active.Share this article:Frontiers in Physiology (2022.)

            "DiagnosisIf you have symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, known as COVID-19, or you've been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, contact your healthcare team. Let them know if you've had close contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19.\n",
            "In the United States, at-home COVID-19 tests are available. Free tests can be mailed to U.S. addresses, or you can purchase tests in stores, pharmacies or online. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA, approves or authorizes the tests. On the FDA website, you can find a list of the tests that are validated and their expiration dates. You also can check with your healthcare professional before buying a test if you have any concerns.\n",
            "When taking a test at home, read the directions that come with the test carefully. Follow the instructions exactly to get as accurate a result as possible.\n",
            "COVID-19 tests also are available from healthcare professionals, some pharmacies and clinics, or at community testing sites.\n",
            "Here are some guidelines for when to take a COVID-19 test:\n",
            "If you have COVID-19 symptoms, test for the illness right away.\n",
            "If you were exposed to the COVID-19 virus but don't have symptoms, wait at least five days after exposure then test.\n",
            "If you have symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19 within the last 30 days, you can test again. But if you were just exposed to the coronavirus and don't have symptoms, you don't need to test.\n",
            "Also, testing before an event or contact with people at high risk of serious illness helps prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n",
            "COVID-19 tests use a sample taken from your nose or throat, or a sample of saliva.\n",
            "Two types of tests can help diagnose COVID-19.\n",
            "Molecular tests. These tests look for genetic material from the COVID-19 virus.\n",
            "Polymerase chain reaction tests, shortened to PCR tests, are molecular tests. You may also see this type of test called an NAAT test, short for nucleic acid amplification test.\n",
            "PCR tests are more accurate than the other type of COVID-19 test, called an antigen test. PCR tests may be done at home. But they are much more likely to be done by a healthcare professional and processed in a lab.\n",
            "Antigen tests. These tests look for viral proteins called antigens.\n",
            "Antigen tests also may be called rapid COVID-19 tests or at-home COVID-19 tests. These tests are useful if you need a quick result.\n",
            "Antigen tests are reliable and accurate, but they are less accurate than PCR tests. This is especially true if you don't have symptoms. If you take an antigen test and are negative for COVID-19, take another antigen test after 48 hours to get the most accurate result.\n",
            "Understanding test resultsIf you have a positive COVID-19 PCR or antigen test, you almost certainly have COVID-19. Another test isn't needed.\n",
            "If you get a negative PCR test, you most likely do not have COVID-19.\n",
            "If you have a negative antigen test, the FDA recommends that you repeat an antigen test two days after the first test. With or without symptoms, repeating the test helps get the correct diagnosis.\n",
            "If you test positive, call a healthcare professional immediately to find out what options are available.\n",
            "Preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus while sickTo prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus to others, stay home and apart from anyone you live with for as long as you have worsening symptoms. If you have a weakened immune system, you will likely need to isolate for longer. How long depends on your symptoms and personal health history. Your healthcare professional can advise you on what's best in your situation.\n",
            "If you must be around others, a face mask helps lower the spread of this coronavirus. During this time, try not to share things like cups or towels, and use a separate bathroom and bedroom. It can help to get more airflow in your home as well.\n",
            "Once you're feeling better and haven’t had a fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven’t taken medicine for fever during that time, you can go back to being around others. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, return to isolation until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. But listen to the advice of your healthcare professional.\n",
            "In the five days after isolation, to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus you can wear a mask, wash your hands, keep your distance from others, test for COVID-19 infection and improve airflow. These actions are helpful even if you never had symptoms but tested positive for COVID-19.More InformationCOVID-19 in babies and childrenCOVID-19 variantHow do COVID-19 antibody tests differ from diagnostic tests?COVID-19 antibody testingCOVID-19 testsShow more related information\n",
            "TreatmentMany people with COVID-19 recover with rest, plenty of fluids and care that manages symptoms. Medicine you can get without a prescription can help, such as:\n",
            "Fever reducers.\n",
            "Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n",
            "Cough syrup or medicine.\n",
            "If you are at high risk of serious COVID-19 illness, your healthcare professional may suggest medicine to prevent mild illness from getting worse. These medicines can include nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid), remdesivir (Veklury) or molnupiravir (Lagevrio).\n",
            "Paxlovid and Lagevrio are taken by mouth as pills. Veklury is given through a needle in a vein.\n",
            "If you're very ill, you may need to be treated in the hospital.\n",
            "Treatment for serious COVID-19 illnessFor people who are in the hospital for COVID-19 care, care is given based on a person's immune system response and the need for oxygen support.\n",
            "Added oxygen may be given through a tube in the nose. Some people may need to have a tube placed in their airway to push air into the lungs. That's called mechanical ventilation. In very severe situations, a machine called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as ECMO, can be used to mimic the function of the heart and lungs.\n",
            "Medicines for severe COVID-19 may be remdesivir, baricitinib (Olumiant) and tocilizumab (Actemra), or a corticosteroid such as dexamethasone.\n",
            "Baricitinib is a pill. Tocilizumab is an injection. Dexamethasone may be either a pill or given through a needle in a vein.\n",
            "Another option may come from blood donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19, called convalescent plasma. The blood is processed to remove blood cells, leaving behind a liquid called plasma that has immune system proteins called antibodies. Convalescent plasma with high antibody levels may be used to help people with a weakened immune system recover from COVID-19.More InformationIs hydroxychloroquine a treatment for COVID-19?Treating COVID-19 at homeCOVID-19 drugs: Are there any that work?Convalescent plasma therapyExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)Show more related information\n",
